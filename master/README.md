We have moved away from the Umbraco platform and are now using straight HTML/CSS/JS. 

You can get a quick tutorial on git commands here:

Whenever you are working on something please PULL from the repo before starting, this is to ensure that you have the latest version of hte files and that there are no conflicts (this leads to more work with merging files). 

Whenever you are done with your change PUSH the change, please add a message with your commit so that others can tell what changes you have made.

Thanks!
