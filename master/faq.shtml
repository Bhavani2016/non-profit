                <h1 class="btn btn-success question">Why focus on clothes?</h1></summary>
            <!-- Question title -->
            <!-- Answer -->
            <p class="info"> The global apparel market is valued at 3 trillion dollars annually and accounts for 2 percent of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Almost 60 million people were employed in the textile & clothing manufacturing sector in 2014. Like oil, it is one of the most profitable industries on the planet. Yet it is also one of the most exploitative and dirty industries in the world. We believe we can change that. </p>

            <!-- Question title -->
            <!-- Answer -->
            <p class="info"> Depends on what position you have applied for. For the Content department, it would be mainly writing intensive: writing blogs and researching on topics. For some of you, video shooting and editing could be an option as well. For HR, it would be mostly administrative duties: creating and updating potential job post on online job boards, responding to new volunteers' emails, on-boarding new volunteers on procedures. We also have a communications and IT department. Communications is essentially the public face of Trusted Clothes, so if you want to come and represent us, we're always glad to have you! IT is the tech guys: all of our hardware and networking issues are resolved through them.</p>
